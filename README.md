# Forensic Network Control System

This project implements a Django-based network control framework designed to provide **secure, selective Internet access for seized mobile devices** during forensic investigations. It integrates with the **OPNsense firewall** to enable fine-grained, case-specific rule management while minimising the risk of remote wipes or unintended data modification.

## üß≠ Purpose

Modern mobile devices require online access to retrieve cloud-based evidence (e.g., iCloud photos, WhatsApp chats, Binance transactions). However, uncontrolled network access poses a risk of data loss due to:
- Remote wipe commands
- Background sync
- Tracking or alert signals

This system allows forensic examiners to **safely bring devices online** in a controlled, monitored environment using:
- DNS-level filtering
- ISP-based rule grouping
- Enriched IP metadata
- Dynamic, per-device firewall rule enforcement

## üîß Features

- üîê Selective firewall rule control (via the OPNsense API)
- üìÑ DNS and IP logging per device
- üåç IP enrichment using third-party services (e.g., `ip-api.com`)
- üß† Automated rule creation based on observed DNS/IP activity
- üñ•Ô∏è Web interface for investigators to monitor and control network access
- üîé Log views showing allowed/blocked connections with metadata
- üß± Alias support for high-performance rule handling (via OPNsense)

## üì¶ Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Django 4.x
- PostgreSQL (or any Django-supported DB)
- OPNsense Firewall (Tested on version 25.1 "Ultimate Unicorn")
- Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS (for frontend)
- Optional: `ip-api.com` for IP enrichment

## üìö Documentation and Resources

This project integrates a Django-based web application with the OPNsense firewall via its API. To fully understand or extend the system, the following official resources are highly recommended:

### OPNsense
OPNsense is an open-source, FreeBSD-based firewall and routing platform used in this project for firewall rule control and DNS handling.

-   Download (ISO/Installer): https://opnsense.org/download/
-   Documentation: https://docs.opnsense.org/
-   API Reference: https://docs.opnsense.org/development/api.html  
‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure your OPNsense installation is version 25.1 or newer (tested version: Ultimate Unicorn 25.1).

### Django Framework
Django is a high-level Python web framework used in this project to manage firewall state, rules, IP enrichment, and provide a frontend interface.

-   Download & Installation:
    Via pip: pip install django
    Or visit: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/
-   Documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/  
‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure your Django installation is higher than 4.x.
